# MaaiiChat
##Small Chat task with the following requirements

- A chatroom-like screen displaying text message bubbles, either incoming or outgoing.
- Each bubble for text message should have a variable size to fit its content. The textual content may be long and contain line breaks.
- Dynamic data source - The user can enter text in a text field and save it to the data source of the chatroom UI. (Barely saving in memory is fine.)
- The direction of message bubble (incoming or outgoing) should be decided by random when saving.

This was done using storyboard without Autolayout and was tested only on the simulator for iPhone 5,6.
There is also a suite of tests for you to lookthrough or run at your leisure.
